### Fast and the Furious
**Fast and the Furious Movie Info**
*Vin Diesel's Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon. This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he's going to save those he loves most.*

*"Fast and Furious 9" sets up Jakob's redemption as he switches sides in the end to work with Dom and his crew, creating possibilities for future movies. Cipher returns as the main villain in "F9," and her exit suggests she is regrouping for another attack, but later turns into an anti-hero in "Fast X."*
